# MyProyects
This is where my academic and personal proyects are. 

Data Extractor:
  Program name:pdfToData.py

    This program was an useful tool, that helped me and my teammates in an final project.
    One of the objectives of that project was extracting data from a bunch PDF documents that all of them have the same format and then analyse this data in an
    Excel document so we can do there graphics and comparations (the class that let us that proyect was about stadistics), so what I did was devolped this tool that transforms
    each one of the PDFs into txt and then made a function to search specific data with a key system, then I append this data that has an specific order into a list, so I can do 
    this function into every PDF that is on an specific folder, and finally append this data that always have the same order into a .txt document, so in there I give the data the
    structure that is used in .csv documents so them can be opened and manipulated in Excel.

    When I showed my teammates my work they where very pleased because I just dont only developed by my own (my teammates dont were really into programation), also
    I saved the team at least 5 to 6 hours of capturing data from the PDFs into de Excel. So, what was really cool about all this, its that at the end I analyse 600 PDFs and 
    extracted the data(al least 9 - 12 data for each PDF ) so I can do more accurated calculus conclusions, insted of doing it with only 90 data.

Rounter automatic configuration:
  Program name: createRouterTxt.py ; 
    
    The objective of this program was to optimize the time spended in the configuration of each router in a network. The program will subnet the IP with the mask that you will         gave to him, and then you can choose the other configurations and adding some of the subnetted IPs into each interface port. You can also customize your router parameters and    add whatever of the options you want. This program will give the user a .txt document that can just be copied and pasted in the terminal, and just with that you will have          finish a router configuration.
