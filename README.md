This is where my academic and personal proyects are. 

Data Extractor

This program was an useful tool, that helped me and my teammates in an final project.
One of the objectives of that project was extracting data from a bunch PDF documents that all of them have the same format and then analyse this data in an
Excel document so we can do there graphics and comparations (the class that let us that proyect was about stadistics), so what I did was devolped this tool that transforms
each one of the PDFs into txt and then made a function to search specific data with a key system, then I append this data that has an specific order into a list, so I can do 
this function into every PDF that is on an specific folder, and finally append this data that always have the same order into a .txt document, so in there I give the data the
structure that is used in .csv documents so them can be opened and manipulated in Excel.

When I showed my teammates my work they where very pleased because I just dont only developed by my own (my teammates dont were really into programation), also
I saved the team at least 5 to 6 hours of capturing data from the PDFs into de Excel. So, what was really cool about all this, its that at the end I analyse 600 PDFs and 
extracted the data(al least 9 - 12 data for each PDF ) so I can do more accurated calculus conclusions, insted of doing it with only 90 data.
